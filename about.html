<p>Goverment regulations are restricting the freedom of the individual actor in the economy. 
An independent currency, an independent reputation system and an independent escrow service make 
- trust redundant.
- the value of contracts redundant
- the law as it is redundant (its just information we can transfer it into a blockchain and vote on it with assymetric keys)
- the monopoly of violence of the goverment redundant.
- the goverment, in which form it might appear or is, redundant.</p>

<p>Lets take the chance and produce what ever you like. Why not make your own toothpaste. In todays economy, you have no chance to enter the market, because of the "ensurence of quality" which is of course nothing less than a contract with the big players to ensure the power of the gov and them.</p>

<p>Lets enter a more diverse and more innovativ economy with less restrictions! </p>

<p>Time is running, in a few years will quantumcomputers be ready to break all our assymetric encryption. So lets use what we have today and prepare for tomorrow.</p>

<p>This site is not fully developed and interacts with the bitcoin test-chain.
If I grepped your attention consider <a href="mailto:teicheld@web.de">contacting me</a> to work on a more decentraliced version of this site. I wrote a rough <a href="whitepaper.html">whitepaper</a> about our roadmap which I have in my mind so far.
I dont care about your skillset, because I want to provide education materials specific for this service to help developers grow up with us.</p>
